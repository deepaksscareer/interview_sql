𝐌𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐓𝐫𝐲: Amazon (Hard Level) hashtag#SQL Interview Question — Solution

Find the 3-month rolling average of total revenue from purchases given a table with users, their purchase amount, and date purchased. Do not include returns which are represented by negative purchase values. Output the year-month (YYYY-MM) and 3-month rolling average of revenue, sorted from earliest month to latest month.

A 3-month rolling average is defined by calculating the average total revenue from all user purchases for the current month and previous two months. The first two months will not be a true 3-month rolling average since we are not given data from last year. Assume each month has at least one purchase.

🌀By solving this, you'll learn how to use Mutiple CTEs, Joins, Group by, Windows & Agg function. Give it a try and share the output! 👇

3-month rolling average is the average of data from the last three months, calculated each month.

1. MonthlyRevenue CTE: Extracts the year and month (in YYYY-MM format) from created_at. Calculates the total revenue for each month, excluding negative values (representing returns).

2. RollingAverage CTE: For each month (mr1), joins it with the previous two months (mr2) using a date difference of up to 2 months. Computes the average total revenue across the current and previous two months.
