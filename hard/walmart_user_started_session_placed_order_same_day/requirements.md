1. JOIN: We're joining the sessions and order_summary tables on user_id.

2. CAST(s.session_date AS DATE): We're casting the session date and order date to DATE to remove the time part for comparison.

3. COUNT(o.order_id): We calculate the total number of orders placed by each user on the same day.

4. SUM(o.order_value): We calculate the total order value for the orders placed on the same day.

5. GROUP BY: We're grouping the result by user_id and session_date to get the totals for each day.
