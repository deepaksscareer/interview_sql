1. MAX(CAST(lg AS INT)): The lg column is cast to INT (assuming it is stored as TEXT), and the maximum value is determined.

2. WHERE year = 2016: Filters the data to include only records from the year 2016.

3. GROUP BY qb: Groups the data by quarterback (qb) to find the longest throw for each quarterback.![img.png](img.png)
