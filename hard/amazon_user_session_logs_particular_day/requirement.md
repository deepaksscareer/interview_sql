𝐌𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐓𝐫𝐲: Amazon (Hard Level) hashtag#SQL Interview Question — Solution

Given the users' sessions logs on a particular day, calculate how many hours each user was active that day. Note: The session starts when state=1 and ends when state=0.

🌀 Trust me, this one will surely challenge you...! Give it a try and share the output! 👇

𝐒𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐦𝐚 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐭:
CREATE TABLE customer_state_log (cust_id VARCHAR(10),state INT,timestamp TIME);

INSERT INTO customer_state_log (cust_id, state, timestamp) VALUES('c001', 1, '07:00:00'),('c001', 0, '09:30:00'),('c001', 1, '12:00:00'),('c001', 0, '14:30:00'),('c002', 1, '08:00:00'),('c002', 0, '09:30:00'),('c002', 1, '11:00:00'),('c002', 0, '12:30:00'),('c002', 1, '15:00:00'),('c002', 0, '16:30:00'),('c003', 1, '09:00:00'),('c003', 0, '10:30:00'),('c004', 1, '10:00:00'),('c004', 0, '10:30:00'),('c004', 1, '14:00:00'),('c004', 0, '15:30:00'),('c005', 1, '10:00:00'),('c005', 0, '14:30:00'),('c005', 1, '15:30:00'),('c005', 0, '18:30:00');

I have provided an explanation and query, but I encourage you to try solving it first. Later, you can check the query for reference.

1. SessionDurations CTE: Use the LAG() function to get the timestamp of the previous state for each cust_id. Filter rows where state=0 because this indicates the end of a session. The session_start is derived from the LAG() value, and session_end is the current timestamp.

2. ActiveHours CTE: Calculate the active duration for each session in minutes using DATEDIFF(MINUTE, session_start, session_end).

3. Final SELECT: Sum the active minutes for each cust_id. Divide the total minutes by 60 to convert them to hours.
