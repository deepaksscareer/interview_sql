In a marathon, gun time is counted from the moment of the formal start of the race while net time is counted from the moment a runner crosses a starting line. Both variables are in seconds.

You are asked to check if the interval between the two times is different for male and female runners. First, calculate the average absolute difference between the gun time and net time. Group the results by available genders (male and female). Output the absolute difference between those two values.

🔍By solving this, you'll learn how to use CTE, UNIONALL, CASE. Give it a try and share the output! 👇

1. WITH AvgTimeDiff: This common table expression (CTE) calculates the average absolute time difference between gun_time and net_time for males and females separately. AVG(ABS(gun_time - net_time)) computes the average absolute difference for each gender.

2. UNION ALL: Combines the results for males and females into a single dataset.

3. ABS(MAX(CASE ... END) - MAX(CASE ... END)): Extracts the average time difference for males and females using a conditional CASE statement. Calculates the absolute difference between these two values.
