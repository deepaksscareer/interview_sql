𝐌𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐓𝐫𝐲: Accenture(Medium Level) hashtag#SQL Interview Question — Solution

Following a recent advertising campaign, the marketing department wishes to classify its 
efforts based on the total number of units sold for each product.

You have been tasked with calculating the total number of units sold for each product 
and categorizing ad performance based on the following criteria for items sold:

Outstanding: 30+
Satisfactory: 20 - 29
Unsatisfactory: 10 - 19
Poor: 1 - 9

Your output should contain the product ID, total units sold in descending order, 
and its categorized ad performance.

🔍By solving this, you'll learn how to use when, case and group by. Give it a try and share the output! 👇

CREATE TABLE marketing_campaign (user_id INT,created_at DATETIME,product_id INT,quantity INT,price INT);

INSERT INTO marketing_campaign (user_id, created_at, product_id, quantity, price) VALUES(1, '2020-01-01', 101, 25, 200),(2, '2020-01-01', 102, 5, 150),(3, '2020-01-02', 103, 15, 300),(4, '2020-01-03', 101, 10, 200),(5, '2020-01-04', 102, 22, 150),(6, '2020-01-05', 104, 8, 120),(7, '2020-01-06', 105, 18, 250),(8, '2020-01-07', 101, 30, 200),(9, '2020-01-08', 103, 20, 300),(10, '2020-01-09', 104, 9, 120);

1. SUM(quantity): This aggregates the total number of units sold for each product_id.

2. CASE Statement: Based on the aggregated SUM(quantity), we assign an appropriate performance category.

3. GROUP BY product_id: This groups the data by product_id so we can calculate the sum for each product.
